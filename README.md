# Equipment-Failure-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model designed for predictive maintenance in industrial equipment. The goal of the project is to predict equipment failure and estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) using various sensor measurements and operational settings. The model uses a combination of regression and classification techniques to identify potential failures and provide accurate predictions for when maintenance should be performed, minimizing downtime and improving operational efficiency.

The project includes:

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and feature engineering on sensor and operational data.

**Model Training:** Building and training regression and classification models (Random Forest, etc.) to predict RUL and Failure Prediction.

**Performance Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance with metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and R-squared.

**Dashboard Integration:** Using the predictions to build an interactive dashboard for visualizing the health status of equipment, remaining useful life, and failure predictions.

This project aims to optimize maintenance schedules, reduce unplanned downtime, and support decision-making in industries that rely on complex machinery.
